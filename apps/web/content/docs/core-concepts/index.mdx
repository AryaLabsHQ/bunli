# Core Concepts

Learn the fundamental concepts that make Bunli powerful and easy to use.

## Key Concepts

### [Commands](/docs/core-concepts/commands)
The building blocks of your CLI. Learn how to define commands with type-safe options, validation, and rich handler contexts.

### Type Inference (Coming Soon)
Bunli's type system provides excellent autocomplete and type safety without manual type annotations.

### Validation (Coming Soon)
Use Standard Schema to validate inputs with any validation library you prefer (Zod, Valibot, etc.).

### Configuration (Coming Soon)
Configure your CLI with bunli.config.ts for consistent behavior across development and production.

## Philosophy

Bunli is built on these core principles:

1. **Type Safety First** - Full TypeScript support with automatic inference
2. **Zero Dependencies** - No external dependencies in the core
3. **Developer Experience** - Fast feedback loops and helpful errors
4. **Production Ready** - Built for real-world CLI applications
